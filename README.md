# What is a Genetic Algorithm?
A genetic algorithm in simple terms in a model where generation after generation learns and adapts from their parents due to a "natural selection-like effect" where the strong are more likely to survive and reproduce.
# How to Run the JS File
For the javascript simulation to work correctly, you must reference p5.js in your html file like I have done in index.html
# Current Problems
My lack of experience in Javascript has resulted in many scope related problems that I'm currently fixing. As a result, the current simulation only demonstrates the first generation, which has no parent to learn from and makes random movements.
