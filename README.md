# What is a Genetic Algorithm?
A genetic algorithm in simple terms in a model where generation after generation learns and adapts from their parents due to a "natural selection-like effect" where the strong are more likely to survive and reproduce.
* The best dot is preserved with identical behavior to next generation
* The other children are randomly mutated with 1% rate
# Data Structures
* `Population` class manages dots and breeds new generations
* `dot` class represents single unit
* `Brain` class provides movement behavior of unit
# UI processing
Visualization made by p5.js, a very cool UI processing library.
